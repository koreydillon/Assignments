The Aucks are performing their experiments on Earth, and plan on transporting the mutant animals back to their home planet of Aurock.

Somehow, the aliens have evolved and developed breeding technology to make cows with integer weights and IQs.\n",

All of your code for the problem solving in this assignment should go into ```a5.ipynb```--you need to expand the given notebook to include your Python code and discussion notes.  \n",

    "For each problem, I provide some skeleton code for you to start your problem solving. Note that most of the code definitions are not complete unless I point out the completion of some certain function such as **greedy** for Problem 3. For each code cell that contains only incomplete code, you need to extend the code implementation.  \n",

    "You also need to solve the problems in the order presented in this document.  That is, you should complete problem 1 first before you approach problems 2 and 3.  The solutions of the later problems are dependent on the solutions to earlier problems.  For example, in Problem 2, you need to parse a data file to create Cow objects.

    "        * Try every possible combination: We could try every way to pick cows and trips to find the one with the most total smartness within the limits. But this takes a very long time, especially with many cows.\r\n",
    "        * Smartly breaking down the problem: We can break the problem into smaller, simpler parts and save the answers to those parts so we don't have to calculate them again. This is faster than trying every combination.\r\n",
    "        * Using smart search methods: These methods look for the best answer while skipping parts that can't be good. This is faster than trying everything but can still take a while.\r\n",

    "**My Thoughts on the Project:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1.  **What steps did I take to solve the problems?**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    * Building the code step by step: I started by making the cow \"thing,\" then loaded the data, and finally made the method to pick cows.\r\n",
    "    * Making the code easy to manage: I broke the problem into smaller parts (functions) that did one job each.\r\n",
    "    * Testing: I added code to check if each part was working correctly.\r\n",
    "    * Finding and fixing errors: I used print statements and checked the code step by step to find and fix errors.\r\n",
    "    * Understanding the problem: I carefully read and understood what the problem asked for.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2.  **What was hard, and how did I deal with it?**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    * Understanding the simple, quick method: At first, I had trouble making the method work correctly with the trip and weight limits. I fixed this by walking through the method with example data.\r\n",
    "    * Data type errors: I had errors because I was using a list when I needed a dictionary. I fixed this by changing the code to use the right data type.\r\n",
    "    * Finding the *best* answer: I had trouble figuring out how to find the absolute best answer. I realized I needed to try every combination or use a smart breakdown method, but I didn't have time to do that. I focused on making the simple, quick method work.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3.  **What did I learn, and how can I use it?**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    * Data types matter: Choosing the right data type (lists vs. dictionaries) is important.\r\n",
    "    * Simple, quick methods have trade-offs: They are fast but don't always give the best answer. They are good when a \"good enough\" answer is okay.\r\n",
    "    * Breaking down problems: Making the code into smaller parts makes it easier to read and fix.\r\n",
    "    * Finding and fixing errors: Using print statements and checking the code step by step is important.\r\n",
    "    * Real-world uses:\r\n",
    "        * Using limited resources: Making the best use of things like internet speed, storage, or cars.\r\n",
    "        * Scheduling: Planning tasks or events to be as efficient as possible.\r\n",
    "        * Finding routes: Finding the shortest or fastest way to get somewhere.\r\n",
    "        * Picking the best items: Like in this project, picking items with the most value within a weight limit.with maximum value within a weight limit.with maximum value within a weight limit."
