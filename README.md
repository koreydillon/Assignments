# Data Analysis & Visualization Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio of my data analysis and visualization projects. I've worked on these projects both independently and as part of collaborative teams, focusing on delivering practical solutions for real-world problems.

Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate:

* **Proficiency in data analysis:** Extracting, cleaning, and interpreting data to uncover valuable insights.
* **Effective data visualization:** Creating clear and impactful visualizations to communicate findings.
* **Problem-solving skills:** Applying data-driven approaches to address real-world challenges.
* **Collaboration and teamwork:** Contributing effectively to group projects.

Feel free to explore the projects to gain a better understanding of my capabilities in data analysis and visualization.
